  <strong>About LoveCalc</strong>
 </h2>
 
 LoveCalc is a Social Engineering Project with the help of which we can trick someone into giving us thier crush/partner name. Try it with your girlfriend/boyfriend and know if you girl/boy is interested in somone else or try it with your crush and see if she tries your name.
 
LoveCalc is made with HTML, CSS and PHP. The way LoveCalc works is when someone tries LoveCalc he/she will be shown random Love percentage and you'll get an email with the names they tried, their public IP address and their User Agent.
 <br><br><i>Update:<br>With this updated version now you have an option to impress your partner by always getting 100% when your name gets triend along with your partner's name. More information on this can be found below. Let me tell you a sectret: You can set up multiple partners if you like to. Husssssshhhh.</i><br>
